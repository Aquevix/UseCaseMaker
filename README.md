This is a refactoring project of Use Case Maker from SourceForge.  The original
can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/use-case-maker/, and I am
blogging my progress at http://test.houseofczetty.com/MrCzettysBlog/.

Please forgive the formatting and colors on my blog.  It is still in flux, 
and I don't have a lot of time to fix it.  It will improve, I promise!
